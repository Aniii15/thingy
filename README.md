# ü©∫ Skin Disease Detection using Deep Learning  

## üìò Overview  
This project aims to build an AI-powered web application that detects **skin diseases** from uploaded images.  
The system uses a **trained deep learning model** built on a **Kaggle skin disease dataset**, and provides an easy-to-use **frontend web interface** for users to upload their details and affected skin images.  

The project is designed to help users ‚Äî especially those in **remote areas or with limited medical access** ‚Äî get quick preliminary insights about possible skin conditions before consulting a dermatologist.

Features  
**AI Model for Skin Disease Detection**  
  - Trained using a **Kaggle dataset** containing labeled images of various skin diseases.  
  - Uses deep learning (CNN-based architecture) for high accuracy.  
  - Predicts the most probable disease from the uploaded image.  

**Frontend Web Application**  
  - User-friendly interface to collect patient details:  
    - Name    
    - Problem description  
    - Blood Pressure (BP)    
    - Image of the affected area  
  - Automatically sends the uploaded image to the trained model for prediction.  
  - Displays the **predicted disease result** on screen.  

**Use Case Scenarios**  
  - Remote health consultation for rural or isolated areas.  
  - Early diagnosis support for patients hesitant to visit clinics.  
  - Helps in identifying **groin-area or other sensitive skin problems** privately.  
  - With future dataset expansion, more diseases can be added for broader coverage.

Tech Stack  

### **Machine Learning / Backend**
- Python üêç  
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch  
- NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib  
- Vscode / Kaggle for model training  

### **Frontend / Web**
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- Flask / FastAPI (for backend integration)  
- Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS (for UI)  

### **Dataset**
- Source: [Kaggle Skin Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- Contains labeled images of multiple skin diseases

How It Works  

1. **Model Training**
   - The dataset from Kaggle is preprocessed (resizing, normalization, augmentation).  
   - The CNN model is trained to classify skin diseases into predefined categories.  
   - The trained model is saved (`model.h5` or `.pt`).  

2. **Frontend Interaction**
   - User opens the website and fills out the form.  
   - Uploads an image of the affected area.  
   - Submits the form.  

3. **Prediction Pipeline**
   - The uploaded image is sent to the backend.  
   - The trained model analyzes it and predicts the disease.  
   - The result is displayed along with patient info (optionally stored in a database).

Future Improvements  
- Add more diseases by training with larger, more diverse datasets.  
- Integrate real-time consultation with dermatologists.  
- Improve accuracy using advanced models (e.g., EfficientNet, Vision Transformers).  
- Add multilingual support for wider accessibility.  
- Enable secure medical record storage and report generation.  

Impact  
This project contributes to **accessible healthcare**, especially for:  
- People in **rural or underdeveloped regions**.  
- **Elderly patients** unable to travel frequently.  
- Individuals seeking **private and early diagnosis** of skin problems.
